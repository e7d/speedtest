		<h3>What does it measure?</h3>
		<p>This speed test provides you with information on four simple indicators about your Internet
			connection:
		</p>
		<table class="table">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Indicator</th>
					<th>What is tested?</th>
					<th>Measurement</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>latency</td>
					<td>delay between you and the server</td>
					<td>reaction time</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>jitter</td>
					<td>variation of the delay</td>
					<td>stability</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>download</td>
					<td>rate of data receiving</td>
					<td>download speed</td>

		<h3>What is the meaning of each indicator?</h3>

		<h4>Latency is the responsiveness of your connection</h4>
		<p>When it is low, it indicates that the information takes little time to travel between you and the
			server.
			The lower it is, the more information flows "in real time". It generally reflects the distance
			traved by
			data between you and the server.</p>

		<h4>Jitter is the stability of your connection</h4>
		<p>When it is low, it indicates that latency does not vary much and that your connection is stable. On
			the
			contrary, when it rises, it indicates that the reactivity of your connection can vary greatly from
			one
			data exchange to another.</p>

		<h4>The download and upload speed are the size of your connection</h4>
		<p>When it is high, a lot of data can be exchanged in a short time between you and the server. This
			makes it
			possible to retrieve and send large files faster.</p>
