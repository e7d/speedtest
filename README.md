# Speed Test

A self-hosted, lightweight speed test implemented in JavaScript, and based on [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest).

## Demo

A demo is available here, running on a Digital Ocean server based on Amsterdam:

- stable: [http://134.209.196.181:8080](http://134.209.196.181:8080)
- develop: [http://134.209.196.181:8081](http://134.209.196.181:8081)

## Usage

### Compatibility

| Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 43     | \*   | 48.0    | 12.10 | 6.0    |

### Features

- IP Address (with ISP) detection
- Latency and jitter tests
- Download and upload bandwidth tests

### Requirements

- Some decent server CPU
- Using HTTPS is highly discouraged, adding an heavy packet size and computing overhead
- Using server compression is also discouraged, adding a computing overhead

### Configuration

You can configure the speed test server following your needs. Find below the list of configurable options through the file `config.json` available at the root level of the server.  
The key corresponds to the JSON path where to affect the value. For example, setting the value `2000` for the key `download.delay` corresponds to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "download": {
    "delay": 2000
  }
}
```

List of configurable options:
| Key | Description | Default value | Possible values |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| analytics.trackingId | The Google Analytics tracking ID to use on the speed test. | | "UA-XXXXXXXX-Y" or empty. |
| ignoreErrors | Ignore the errors yielded by upload/download requests. If false, the test will be aborted at the first error. | true | true or false. |
| endpoints | The available endpoints list. | | See [Endpoints configuration](#Endpoints_configuration) below. |
| endpoint.xhr | The endpoint to request for XHR. | current location | Any http:// or https:// endpoint exposing this speed test. |
| endpoint.websocket | The endpoint to request for WebSocket. | current location | Any ws:// or wss:// endpoint exposing this speed test. |
| ip.path | The path of the IP test on the XHR endpoint. | ip | |
| latency.path | The path of the latency test on the WebSocket endpoint. | ping | |
| latency.count | The count of latency requests to emit during the latency test. | null | Any positive integer. |
| latency.duration | The duration in milliseconds of the latency test. | 5000 | Any positive integer. |
| latency.gracetime | The duration in milliseconds at start of the latency test during which results are ignored. Used for test warm-up. | 1000 | Any positive integer. |
| download.path | The path of the download test on the XHR endpoint. | download | |
| download.streams | The number of concurrent streams to use during the download test. | 6 | Any positive integer. |
| download.delay | The delay in milliseconds between the first request of each stream. | 200 | Any positive integer. |
| download.duration | The duration in milliseconds of the download test. | 10000 | Any positive integer. |
| download.gracetime | The duration in milliseconds at start of the download test during which results are ignored. Used for test warm-up. | 2000 | Any positive integer. |
| download.size | The size in bytes downloaded on each download request. | 8388608 (8M) | Any positive integer. |
| download.adjustSize | Auto adjust download packets size, depending on bandwidth. | true | |
| download.minSize | The minimum size in bytes downloaded on each download request, to avoid excessively small requests. | 1048576 (1M) | Any positive integer. |
| download.maxSize | The maximum size in bytes downloaded on each download request, to avoid excessively huge requests. | 104857600 (100M) | Any positive integer. |
| upload.path | The path of the upload test on the XHR endpoint. | upload | |
| upload.streams | The number of concurrent streams to use during the upload test. | 6 | Any positive integer. |
| upload.delay | The delay in milliseconds between the first request of each stream. | 200 | Any positive integer. |
| upload.duration | The duration in milliseconds of the upload test. | 10000 | Any positive integer. |
| upload.gracetime | The duration in milliseconds at start of the upload test during which results are ignored. Used for test warm-up. | 2000 | Any positive integer. |
| upload.size | The size in bytes uploaded on each upload request. | 20971520 (2M) | Any positive integer. |
| upload.adjustSize | Auto adjust upload packets size, depending on bandwidth. | true | |
| upload.minSize | The minimum size in bytes uploaded on each upload request, to avoid excessively small requests. | 262144 (256K) | Any positive integer. |
| upload.maxSize | The maximum size in bytes uploaded on each upload request, to avoid excessively huge requests. | 20971520 (20M) | Any positive integer. |

#### Endpoints configuration

```JSON
{

    {
      "label": "FR",
      "uri": "http://speedtest-fr.localhost:5080"
    },
    {

[![Docker Stars](https://img.shields.io/docker/stars/e7db/speedtest.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/e7db/speedtest)

#### Run the Speed Test container

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 e7db/speedtest
```

#### Store the results permanently

To store results permanently, you need a volume:

```sh
docker volume create speedtest_results
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v speedtest_results:/app/results e7db/speedtest
```

**Note:** Results are never cleaned automatically, used space will grow over time.

#### Use a custom configuration

To use a custom configuration through the `config.json` file, mount it through a read-only volume:

```sh
docker run --name speedtest -d -p 80:80 -v /path/to/config.json:/app/web/config.json:ro e7db/speedtest
```
